# git-dir

Creates a folder with subfolders for each git branch.  

Run in the directory which contains folder .git

Default name for the enveloping folder is git-dir.  
A subdirectory name for each branch will be prefexed by index to keep 
the subdirectories sorted in the branch creation order 
(branches 'main' and 'master' will not be prefexed).
